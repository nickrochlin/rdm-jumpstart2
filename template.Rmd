Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

The following can be used for erroneous code, incorrect output, and proper code with correct output. The otuput at the moment is a little jarring. We'll fix this.    

```{r class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning"}
mtcars[1:5, "mpg"]
```

```{r df-drop-ok, class.source="bg-success"}
mtcars[1:5, "mpg", drop = FALSE]
```

All code is shown by default. You can change this default in the YAML by swapping `code_folding: show` to `code_folding: hide`.

To override this default, when `code_folding: show` is true:

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
2  # code is hidden initially
```

And when `code_folding: hide` is true:

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
2  # code is hidden initially
```


To create nice tables from a chunk of RMarkdown and to solve the problem with code chunks not running, you can adapt the following example:

```{r, data-isolation, results = 'hide'}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars) |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```
