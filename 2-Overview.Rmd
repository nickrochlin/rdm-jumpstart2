## Day 2

We'll begin today with a review of how RDM practices fit into transparent and reproducible work flows and help to address certain aspects of bias in research. From there, we'll further the conversation about reproducibility and the choice of using a coding language by exploring some of the differences between applications like Excel and R and their impact on how one works with research data. After that we'll move into getting set up in R with some hands-on activities and initial cleaning of the data.

By the end of today, you will be able to:

* Articulate how RDM practices impact bias and reproducibility.
* Situate the benefits of using R over Excel.
* Be comfortable launching an RProject in RStudio and importing data into R.
