## Day 4

Today weâ€™re really going to jump into R! We start with an introduction to creating data visualizations in R. We then work through a series of activities to address how to resolve errors encountered in R. We wrap up with exporting from R.

By the end of today, you will be able to:

* Build common visualizations in R.
* Identify common errors in R and how to get help resolving them.
* Save and export content generated in R.
