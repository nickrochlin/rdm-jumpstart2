## Day 5

Today is all about depositing data and other materials for preservation and reuse after a research project is complete. We'll start with an overview of what needs to be considered as it relates to choosing how and where data and accompanying materials can be deposited. We'll then look at Borealis specifically, the national data repository used by many post-secondary institutions in Canada. Lastly, we'll do a live demo deposit into Borealis.

By the end of today, you will be able to:

* Articulate considerations in where and what to deposit.
* Be comfortable making a basic data deposit into Borealis.
