## Welcome

Welcome to RDM Jumpstart, 2025!

## Preload

We have a few things to set up in advance of Monday...

### Tech Setup

During this workshop we will be using R, OSF, and Borealis to explore best practices in Research Data Management with a focus on reproducible workflows.

We ask that you:

* [Install R and RStudio on your computer](6-EXT-RRStudio.html).
* [Create an OSF account](6-EXT-osfSetup.html).
* [Log in to the Borealis sandbox](6-EXT-Borealis.html).

### Background Reading

Please briefly review:

* [Tri-Agency RDM Policy](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy-frequently-asked-questions).
* [Guide to preparing data management plans](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/apply-demande/guides/guide_preparing_data_management_plan-guide_preparation_plan_gestion_donnees-eng.aspx).
* [The Documenation of the data set we'll be using](https://odesi.ca/en/details?id=/odesi/doi__10-5683_SP3_RDS0CK.xml).
