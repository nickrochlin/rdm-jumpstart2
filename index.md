# Research Data Management Jumpstart

To begin realizing the goals and aspirations outlined during the Compute Ontario Training Summit in April 2024, **RDM Jumpstart** will pilot a free national week-long research data program in spring 2025. This course will enable participants to meet the [Tri-Agency Research Data Management (RDM) Policy](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy) requirements, and provide foundational skills in the tools and concepts that are crucial in conducting open and transparent research, which form the backbone of RDM best practices. Students will develop baseline research data and computational skills that will act as a trajectory into the more advanced topics taught in the regionally-offered summer schools and workshops.

## Hold the date

RDM Jumpstart will run **May 12 - 16, 2025**, inclusive, and run for approximately 5 hours / day. This event will be delivered over Zoom.
