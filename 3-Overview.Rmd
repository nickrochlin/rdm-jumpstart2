## Day 3

Today starts with an introduction to dependencies in scripting environments and how this impacts computational reproducibility. This will include using a package to enhance the reproducibility in R. We then dig a little deeper into R, first with an introduction to common data types in R, then moving onto some exploratory analysis of the data.

By the end of today, you will be able to:

* Set up a reproducible environment in R.
* Articulate the basic data structures used in R.
* Conduct basic exploratory analysis of data in R.
