## Day 1

We'll start today with an introduction of some basic concepts and principles related to Research Data Management (RDM). We will then look at a data science workflow, which begins post data collection, as an underlying framework to guide what we'll cover and the tools we'll be using over the next several days. We'll then get our project started using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Lastly, we'll review data management planning - the things to consider about your data throughout a research project, before you begin.

By the end of today, you will be able to:

* Articulate what research data are and what RDM is.
* Situate R, OSF, and Borealis within the research data life cycle.
* Identify the value of a data management plan.
* Articulate the role of licencing as it relates to research data.
* Have a basic familiarity with OSF.
* Be familiar with the project structure and project files that we'll be using this week.
