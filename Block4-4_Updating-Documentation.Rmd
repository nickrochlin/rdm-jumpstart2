## Updating Documentation

:::question

Now that we've covered some decent ground in R, let's return to our README file and see if there's anything that needs to be updated.

Things to consider:

* We  changed all the column names from our original dataset, and have created a new file to reflect the cleaned column names.
* We recoded a few variables and have created another new file that has the cleaned column names and the recoded variables.
* We created a new script file (possibly 2 script files).

**Question:** How do we want to record these changes in our documentation?
