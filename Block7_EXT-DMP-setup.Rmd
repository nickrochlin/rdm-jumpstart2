## DMP Assistant Setup

The DMP Assistant is a platform that we will use to create a data management plan (DMP) for the series, which will begin in Block 1 and will continue throughout the program.  To use the DMP Assistant, you'll need to create an account by following the steps below:

1. Go to the DMP Assistant Website: <a href="https://dmp-pgd.ca/">https://dmp-pgd.ca/</a>

2. Fill out your first and last name, email, organization (University of Victoria), and then choose a password.  You should receive an email confirming your successful account setup, and now you're good to go! 

If you run into any issues with this process, please reach out to the program organizer for assistance.
